Render is a cloud application platform that allows users to build, deploy, and scale applications with ease.
While there I worked on many parts of the Render application. 

- Building out new features for the Render dashboard. 
- Developing and maintaining the Design System using React and TypeScript
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products
