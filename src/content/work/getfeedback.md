GetFeedback is a company that provides a customer experience platform, where users can collect feedback from their customers and analyze it to improve their products and services.

While there I primarily focused on building out the various web platforms, including the marketing website, blogs, and documentation sites. I also worked on improving the user experience of the platform.
