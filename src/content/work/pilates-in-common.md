Founded a small startup to develop schedule management software for Pilates and Yoga studios. Designed and developed the website and portal as a full-stack application, to allow studio owners the ability to manage their users subscriptions, session booking, and payments. Implemented a robust payment system using Stripe. Ensured a seamless user experience by implementing responsive design and intuitive navigation. Designed for less technical users, it maintained a clean and simple interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use the platform.
