Restaurant Gary Danko is a highly acclaimed fine-dining establishment in San Francisco. Known for its refined combination of classic French cuisine with an inventive use of local, seasonal ingredients.

The original site was Flash-based and was not working for mobile devices. A new design was created to be a single page with a video background to enhance the overall visual appeal. The WordPress site allowed the team to manage the menu, events, and information pages more efficiently.
